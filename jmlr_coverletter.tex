Dear Editors:

We are writing to submit our manuscript ``Google Deepmind Absent Supervisor Partial Solution'' to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.

Our manuscript studies \red{AI Safety, Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning} which is important because of \red{AI Safety is open problem, The alignment problem is open, and this problem can be indpendently studied in the context of google's ai grid worlds}.

This paper extends the work of Google Deepmind's AI Safety Gridwolds paper.

We suggest the following action editors and referees for our submission.

Action Editors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Alekh Argarwal, Google Research ( alekhagarwal@google.com)}
    \item \red{Quentin Berthet, Google Research (qberthet@google.com)}
    \item \red{Silvia Chiappa, Google Deepmind}
\end{itemize}

Reviewers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{David Abel, Deepmind (dmabel@deepmind.com)}
    \item \red{Maximilian Alber, TU Berlin (maximilian.albere@tu-berlin.com)}
    \item \red{Devansh Arpit}

\end{itemize}

Our submission has the following keywords: \red{Absent Supervisor}, \red{Gridworlds}, \red{Deepmind}, \red{Reinforcement Learning}.

As the corresponding author, I confirm that none of the co-authors listed below have a conflict of interest with the action editors and referees I suggest above.

Sincerely, 
\medskip
\red{Drew Remmenga}
